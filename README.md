# Coding Challenges Solutions

Hi! This repository contains my solutions to the [coding challenges](https://codingchallenges.fyi/) proposed by John Crickett.
Coding Challenges are a great way to improve our skills through deliberate practice.

Each challenge consists of a complete application, that can be implemented in the spare time over a week or two. John proposes one challenge a week (I'm never going to follow his schedule so fast!!).

In this repository you can find my solutions to the challenges. Most of the solutions will be written in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) (e.g. console applications), but I'll see which technology to choose based on the particular challenge.

Enjoy!
